      <span id="para-sty"> 
        Jodhpur in Rajasthan is known as the ‘Blue City’ as so many of this city’s 
        buildings are painted in a Brahmin blue colour. Residents did this to distinguish 
        themselves as Brahmins. This isn’t the only history to be found here as it’s also 
        home to the magnificent Mehrangarh Fort. Inside one of India’s largest forts is Maharaja 
        Gaj Singh II’s personal collection of riches, and there are a lot of them, with over 15,000 
        treasures to see in total
