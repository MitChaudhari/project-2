For this project, you will add CSS to the 3-page website you built for project 1. 

Deliverables & Milestones 
1. First Deliverable: Use your Project One directory in Github to create a Project Two directory. You can branch it or create a new empty repostory and just copy and past your project 1 code. If you want to learn branching, seek help videos online. Create a new Basecamp post under "Project Two" with a link to your new directory. Your post should include:
       1.A The URL to your Project 2 GitHub repository, and the URL to your index.html Github Pages live link
       1.B Six screen capture images of successful validation. One HTML and one CSS validation for each website page (Use the live link to validate)
       1.C CTwo questions eliciting feedback from fellow students
        
2. Second Deliverable: Give constructive comments to help at least three other students. Post a picture of those three comments on your Basecamp folder.

3. Final Deliverable: You will receive a list on your Basecamp post of required fixes from the professor or TA. Fix your code and edit your original Basecamp post with the words "FINAL TURN IN".
